## How to use this

- Questions are compiled from publicly reported interview experiences. Nothing here is confidential. Interview loops change constantly and vary by team, level, and region, so treat each company section as a map of what that company cares about, not a script of what you will be asked.
- Start with [Common Questions Asked Across Companies](#common-questions-asked-across-companies). These are the questions that recur across many companies. Each one is listed once, with the companies that ask it, so nothing is repeated in the company sections.
- Then go to your target companies. Each company section has the roles it covers, the interview loop as publicly reported, and the company-specific questions grouped by topic.
- Wherever we have an answer, it is linked right below the question. We will keep adding answers.

## Common Questions Asked Across Companies

> These questions come up in AI Engineering interviews at many companies. Each question is listed once here, with the companies where it (or a company-specific version of it) is asked. Work through these first.

>
> **Interview loop, as publicly reported:** Recruiter screen (~30 min, substantive and failable) → CodeSignal-style or live coding assessment (~70–90 min, one practical problem in ~4 progressive levels) → virtual onsite of roughly five rounds: project deep-dive, one or two coding rounds, system design, and a dedicated values/culture round. Reported end-to-end: 3 weeks to ~2 months. Some MLE loops now include an AI-collaboration round where Claude is provided and you are graded on how you direct and verify it.

>
> **Interview loop, as publicly reported:** Recruiter screen → paired coding round → an architecture presentation round on a legal-workflow system → an evaluation-design round → a customer/partner-scenario round. Domain rigour and grounding matter more than algorithmic puzzles.
>
> **Also prepare:** the [common questions](#common-questions-asked-across-companies) tagged Harvey under [RAG and Retrieval](#rag-and-retrieval), [Evaluation and Observability](#evaluation-and-observability), [Coding and Data Structures](#coding-and-data-structures).

#### Coding and Data Structures

  - Answer: [Chunking Strategies for RAG](https://outcomeschool.com/blog/chunking-strategies-for-rag)

#### RAG and Retrieval

- A lawyer asks about a 200-page credit agreement where the operative clause on page 140 depends on a defined term on page 8. How do you build retrieval that gets this right?

#### Safety, Security and Responsible AI

- Design the safety stack for voice cloning: consent, watermarking and abuse response.

#### Multimodal, Speech and Voice AI

- Budget the end-to-end latency for a real-time voice agent. Why is time-to-first-audio a different problem from an LLM's time-to-first-token?

> **Roles this covers:** ML Engineer (ASR / NLP), Research Scientist, Software Engineer (clinical products), Forward Deployed / Implementation Engineer.
>
> **Interview loop, as publicly reported:** A clinical-ASR depth round, an evaluation-design round (there is rarely a single correct note), a healthcare-integration systems round, and a privacy/compliance round.
>
> **Also prepare:** the [common questions](#common-questions-asked-across-companies) tagged Abridge under [RAG and Retrieval](#rag-and-retrieval), [Safety, Security and Responsible AI](#safety-security-and-responsible-ai), [Multimodal, Speech and Voice AI](#multimodal-speech-and-voice-ai).

#### ML and DL Fundamentals

- Turn a conversation into billable diagnosis codes. What is the accuracy bar, and how do you build to it?

#### Inference, Serving and GPU Performance

- The note should be ready before the clinician leaves the room. Build me the latency budget, and tell me where the money goes.

#### RAG and Retrieval

- The patient's chart already lists their medications. How would you use that to improve transcription of drug names, and how would you keep it from backfiring?

#### Agents and Tool Use

- Design a service that turns the conversation into draft orders: labs, imaging, referrals, prescriptions, via tool calls against the EHR.
  - Answer: [How does Function Calling work in LLMs?](https://outcomeschool.com/blog/how-does-function-calling-work-in-llms)

#### AI System Design

- Walk me through writing a finished note back into Epic. What goes wrong?

#### Evaluation and Observability

- Edit rate is the obvious measure of clinician trust. What does it hide, and what would you instrument instead?

#### Safety, Security and Responsible AI

- A generated note contains a medication the patient never mentioned. Treat that as a safety incident: how do you detect it before a clinician sees it?
- Clinicians will not sign what they cannot verify. How would you build span-level provenance from every line of the note back to the conversation?
- PHI is in every audio file, transcript and note you touch. How does that shape the architecture, and what can you send to a third-party model API?

#### Multimodal, Speech and Voice AI

#### ML and DL Fundamentals

- Behaviour cloning on teleoperation data has a well-known failure mode. What is it, and what do you do about it on a real humanoid?
- A whole-body controller trained entirely in simulation has to run on real hardware. What transfers, what does not, and how do you close the gap?
- Where does reinforcement learning fit on top of imitation learning for manipulation, and what makes the reward the hard part?

#### Inference, Serving and GPU Performance

- A colleague wants to move the semantic layer to the cloud so you can use a much bigger model. Walk me through the latency budget.

#### AI System Design

- Design the teleoperation data pipeline. Why is data collection the bottleneck in robotics rather than compute?
- You have 10 hours of demonstrations for a new task and budget for 50 more. How do you decide what to collect, and what return do you expect?

#### Multimodal, Speech and Voice AI

- What is a vision-language-action model, and how is it different from an LLM with tools?

#### AI System Design

- You have hundreds of millions of fleet miles. How do you find and use the rare scenarios that matter?
- Design a system that finds driving segments similar to a given one across the entire fleet archive.
- You are opening in a new city. Structure the safety case.

- Disengagement rate is a weak safety proxy. How would you actually measure whether the Driver is safe enough to ship?
- How do you build a simulator you would trust to gate a release?
- Two days before a release decision, simulation shows a 15% increase in hard-braking events in one scenario cluster. Walk me through what you do.

#### Multimodal, Speech and Voice AI

- Why carry lidar, radar and cameras rather than cameras alone? Where would you fuse them?

## Forward-Deployed and Enterprise AI

### Palantir

> **Roles this covers:** Forward Deployed Engineer, Forward Deployed Software Engineer, Software Engineer, Data Engineer, Deployment Strategist, AIP engineer.

> **Interview loop, as publicly reported:** Recruiter call (~30 min) → technical screen (live coding or HackerRank: a coding challenge, a SQL query and an API task) → onsite of three 60-minute rounds drawn from decomposition, learning, coding, re-engineering and system design → hiring-manager round that revisits weaker areas. Decomposition is the signature round.

#### RAG and Retrieval

- Users ask “how many open orders are blocked on a supplier issue?” Plain RAG gets this wrong. Why, and what's the right architecture?

#### Agents and Tool Use

- What is an ontology in the Palantir sense, and why put LLM agents on top of one instead of on raw tables and documents?
- Design an LLM agent that files and updates work orders in a customer's ERP: real writes to a production system. How do you make that safe?

#### Behavioral and Culture

- Why Palantir, and why this team? Tell me about a time you pushed back on a customer request.
- Palantir works with defence and intelligence agencies. How do you think about that, and what would you do if asked to build something you're uncomfortable with?
